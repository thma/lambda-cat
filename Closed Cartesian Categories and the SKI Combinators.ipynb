    "He presents the idea to compile haskell programs into a expressions of closed cartesian categories by $\\lambda$-elimination.\n",

    "The process applied reminded me of the [bracket abstraction](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~blynn/lambda/sk.html) used when compiling $\\lambda$-terms to $SKI$-Combinators.\n",

    "$\\lambda$-terms can be converted to variable free combinator terms with a process called bracket abstraction.\n",
    "Bracket abstraction $[]$ is defined by the following equations:\n",

    "\\begin{align} \n",
    "[\\lambda x.x]   & = I \\\\\n",
    "[\\lambda x.y]   & = Ky \\\\\n",
    "[\\lambda x.P Q] & = S [\\lambda x.P] [\\lambda x.Q]\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the combinators $I$, $K$, and $S$ are defined as follows:\n",

    "In Haskell this combinators could be implemented as follows (we have to use lower case letters as Uppercase first letters are reserved for contructors in Haskell):\n",

    "Once the $\\lambda$-terms are compiled to combinator terms, these terms can be interpreted quite efficiently as they don't contain any variables and so no environment-handling is needed.\n",
