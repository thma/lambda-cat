# Lambda Cat

## disclaimer: 

This code is heavily based on Philip Zuckers 
[http://www.philipzucker.com/compiling-to-categories-3-a-bit-cuter/](http://www.philipzucker.com/compiling-to-categories-3-a-bit-cuter/)

I forked from a [specific branch of his repository](https://github.com/philzook58/not-bad-ccc/tree/fan2).
All the really complicated stuff is his. I just filled the dots, cleaned up the code a bit and added an interpreter that executes CCC code.

I'm particlulary interested to research the parallels between compiling lambda to CCC and compiling lambda to (SKI) combinators.
